## What is this?
I intend to add my remarks on papers, or things in general. **Clearly the subjects, be it paper, software or _thing_ is not my own work** but I am merely _remarking_ on them.
## [On FLOW2](https://github.com/ImanHosseini/MiscWritings/blob/main/Remarks/OnFLOW2.pdf)
This is some remarks about these papers: [Frugal Optimization for Cost-related Hyperparameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01571) , [FLAML: A Fast and Lightweight AutoML Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04706) by some folks at Microsoft Research.
